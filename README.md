<h1>ABOUT:</h1> 
A multithreaded Java program to calculate individual digits of pi using Bellard's implementation of Plouffe's Algorithm. <br>
This project was developed as an activity of the Francis Marion University chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery. <br>
Special Thanks go to the FMU Physics and Engineering department for their help and gracious use of the Patriot Supercomputing Cluster. <br>

<h1>USAGE:</h1>
This project was developed as a learning activity, and uses formulas and code developed by other people (namely Fabrice Bellard) as a basis. As such, it should not be used for commercial purposes, and no guarantees can be given for its suitability for non-commercial purposes.
<br>That said, you are free to download, modify, and display the project as you like. We only ask that you give proper credit to contributors and formula authors.
